# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am a tech enthusiast with a strong understanding of **Cyber Security** and **Cloud Computing**. I have hands-on experience with *AWS Technical Essentials* and *Google Computing Engine*, which has equipped me with a broad understanding of cloud services and their applications.

My knowledge extends to the domain of *Project Management*, where I apply my technical skills to ensure efficient and effective execution of projects. I am always eager to learn and adapt to new technologies and challenges in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
